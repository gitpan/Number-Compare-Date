=head1 NAME

Number::Compare::Date - Like Number::Compare, but for epoch seconds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Number::Compare::Date;

  my $y2k = Number::Compare::Date->new(">=2000-01-01");

  if ($y2k->(time))
    { print "Run for the hills, the y2k bug's gonna eat you " }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple extension to Number::Compare that allows you to compare
dates against numbers (which should be epoch seconds.)  The value
that is compared can either be epoch seconds:

  my $perl583 = Number::Compare::Date->new("<1072915199");

Or it can be anything Date::Parse can recognise:

  my $perl583 = Number::Compare->new('<Wed, 31 Dec 2003 23:59:59');

See L<Date::Parse> for more formats.

  $test =~ m{^
	     ([<>]=?)?   # comparison
	     (.*?)       # value
	     $}ix
    or croak "don't understand '$test' as a test";

  # check if the target is all digits
  unless ($target =~ m/^\d+$/)
    { $target = str2time($target) }

  return "$comparison $target"
}
